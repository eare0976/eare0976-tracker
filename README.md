This simple one page website collects recipe data from users as a convenient recipe tracking application. 

A lot of the code has been adapted from previous tutorial classes regarding forms and javascript. Otherwise most of the code was original or somewhat sourced or influenced from online resources such as W3Schools, replit, and mozilla.
